# DS_Class_2019-20

This repository contains homeworks and tests from my high school Data Science Class, taught by Dr. Samsonau at PRISMS. 

Textbook used are R for Data Science & An Introduction to Statistical Learning. 
Contents learning are: data visualization, transformation, linear regression, supervised and unsupervised learning (KNN, CV, Decision Tree, Random Forest, SVM, PCA, Clustering) and text mining.

Look into tests and projects for a quick overview of content. 
* "Project" contains code for an interactive visualization project of suicide rates over the past 30 years. The other repository here https://github.com/helenjiang21/Suicides-rate-overview contains detailed explanation, codes, and a demo video of this project.
* "aProject" contains code for anime recommendation system using user-based collaborative filtering. 
* "Test" contains code for visualizing employee retention rates. 
* "Test_Reg&Cla" contains code for regression and classification models for predicting heating loads for households. 
* "alice_Test" contains code for a text-mining project on Alice in Wonderland.

In retrospect, the naming for folders and commits are not clear enough. So I hope this Readme written 2 years later can clarify things up a bit.

A huge thank-you to Dr. Sergey Samsonau and other DS classmates.
